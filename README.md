# ZENO Introduction

Welcome to the ZENO Developer Platform. Here we provide SDKs for developer to build AR apps and AR games blended with virtual and physical reality in a realistic and sharing experieance. For high level concepts of ZENO, please checkout this [documentation](https://zeno-lab.gitbook.io/story/core-concepts).

## Features
With ZENO's API and supporting components (UI, rendering, tooling, etc), developers can easily make virtual worlds in games or apps interact with surrounding physical objects, and create great AR expereinces that are only limited by imaginations. 

Right now this SDK works with the **Type I Zones**, or the **Anchored Zones**, and supports zone creation, sharing, localizing, placement, navigation, occlusion etc. This feature is working as of today, and available for proof-of-concept testing, anytime, anywhere.

Checkout the example apk [ZenoDemo.apk](https://github.com/zeno-lab-dev/zeno-intro/releases/tag/zeno-demo-v0.3.0)), which demostrate the concept of the use of Anchored Zone. You can install and play with it in an Android phone (requires ARCore support).

## Future Plan
Only with Type I Zone is not the full story. One of the main goal is to support **Type II Zones**, or the **Global Zones**. And there are other components in the plan, such as **World Editor**, **World Engine** etc. Please stay tune.

As the first step, ZENO developer platform supports Unity right now. And for other platforms (e.g. XR Headsets/glasses, Unreal Engine, native or web), they are also in our wish list.


## Get Started
We are still preparing the ZENO Unity SDK repository. It will be available to use in the coming weeks.

Please visit ZENO's [gitbook](https://zeno-lab.gitbook.io/story) for more background story.
